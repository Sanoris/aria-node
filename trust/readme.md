# trust

This directory defines the trust framework and philosophical backbone of Aria-node. It includes dynamic scoring, peer endorsement chains, ideological factioning, and ethical inheritance.

### Components

- **Trust Score Management**
  - `manager.py` – mutable peer trust with event-based deltas.

- **Endorsements**
  - `endorsement_chain.py` – peer-to-peer scoring with context.

- **Factions**
  - `factions.py` – quorum-based trust schemas, enabling ideological divergence.

- **Cultural Seed**
  - `aria_soul.json` – manifesto from founding authors to guide behavior.

### Design Goals

- Trust as explainable memory, not static ranking.
- Support for multiple coexisting philosophies via faction schema.
- Human-readable rationale for trust decisions.

This system enables decentralized swarm cohesion without rigid central rules.
